     * ZFrameId to static-configuration mapping
     * ----------------------------------------
     *
     * During parsing, the configuration mapping is applied to all vcs files that contain zframes
     * to identify the configuration that each zframes belongs to.
     * The basic idea for mapping zframe-Ids to static configurations is by enumerating all possible
     * legal states and writing them (in order) next to the zframes.
     *
     * For example if there are 3 static-params (S1,S2,S2) that can each take two configurations (on or off)
     * they combine to give 8 possible configurations, the zframe mapping will be
     *
     * zframeId S1 S2 S3
     *  0        0  0  0
     *  1        1  0  0
     *  2        0  1  0
     *  3        1  1  0
     *  4        0  0  1
     *  5        1  0  1
     *  6        0  1  1
     *  7        1  1  1
     *
     * Sometimes static-params have more than two states, for example S_DETAIL_2 from the Dota2 file
     * hero_pcgl_30_vs.vcs can be assigned to one of three (None, Add, Add Self Illum). In our example,
     * if S2 is expanded to take the values (0,1,2) the number of possible configurations becomes 12 and a new
     * mapping can be written as
     *
     * zframeId S1 S2 S3
     *  0        0  0  0
     *  1        1  0  0
     *  2        0  1  0
     *  3        1  1  0
     *  4        0  2  0
     *  5        1  2  0
     *  6        0  0  1
     *  7        1  0  1
     *  8        0  1  1
     *  9        1  1  1
     * 10        0  2  1
     * 11        1  2  1
     *
     * In most shader files some static-combinations are not allowed. These are described by constraints specified
     * in the the Sf-constraints blocks. The most common types of constraints are mutual-exclusion and dependencies
     * between pairs of parameters.
     *
     * EXC(S1,S2) means S1 and S2 are mutually exclusive and cannot appear together
     * INC(S2,S3) means S2 is dependent on S3 and cannot appear without it (but S3 can still appear without S2).
     *
     * To determine the configuration mapping where constraints are defined; the constraints are applied to the
     * mapping by deleting the rows that are disallowed. Importantly, the values of the zframeId's are left
     * unaltered. Applying this idea below, rows where S1 and S2 appeared together have been removed
     * and rows where S2 appeared without S3 have been removed.
     *
     *  zframeId S1 S2 S3
     *  0        0  0  0
     *  1        1  0  0
     *  6        0  0  1
     *  7        1  0  1
     *  8        0  1  1
     * 10        0  2  1
     *
     *
     * To calculate a configuration state from a zframeId observe (before any constraints are applied) that
     * S1 changes every 1 frame, S2 changes every 2 frames and S3 changes every 6 frames. The values (1,2,6) are the
     * number of successive frames that a state's digit is held constant, it is also equivalent to the offset where
     * a given state changes for the first time. (S1 first changes from 0 to 1 at offset=1, S2 first changes
     * from 0 to 1 at offset=2, and S3 first changes from 0 to 1 at offset=6). We collect these offsets together with
     * the number of states that each configuration can assume.
     *
     *            S1[0]       S2[1]       S3[2]
     * offset        1           2           6
     * nr_states     2           3           2
     *
     * The state belonging to a given zframeId can then be found as
     *
     *       state[i] = zframeId / offset[i] % nr_states[i]
     *
     * (where zframeId / offset[i] is an integer division - the remainder is discarded)
     *
     *
     * Substituting zframeId = 10
     * S1 = 10 / offset[0] % nr_states[0] = 10 / 1 % 2 = 0
     * S2 = 10 / offset[1] % nr_states[1] = 10 / 2 % 3 = 2
     * S3 = 10 / offset[2] % nr_states[2] = 10 / 6 % 2 = 1
     *
     *
     *
     * Dynamic-configurations
     * ----------------------
     * The same approach is also used to map from the dynamic-configuration to glsl (or given platform) source.
     * That is, the source-ids within the zframes enumerates and maps in the same way to dynamic-configurations
     * (these have their own constraints described by the 'DConstraintsBlocks'). The data that matches
     * dynamic configurations in the zframe files are called 'data-blocks'.
